In machine learning, imbalanced datasets can cause bias in the results of the algorithm. In order to achieve excellent performance, the datasets are processed before being run through the machine learning algorithm. Typically, in solving a neural network, more data is better. However, if that dataset is large enough and unnecessary, it is possible to reduce the dataset without greatly compromising the performance of the trained system.
